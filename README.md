# Number Tables Snake Game
Welcome to the Number Tables Snake Game, a project that combines the excitement of a classic snake game with the educational benefits of learning number tables. This C++ implementation offers an engaging way for players, especially children, to reinforce their understanding of multiplication.

# Overview
In this game, players control a snake whose length increases with each fruit consumed, following a unique pattern. The growth is determined by multiples of a specific number chosen by the player. This innovative approach not only makes learning multiplication tables enjoyable but also provides a dynamic and interactive learning environment.

# Features
Multiplicative Growth: The snake's length increases based on multiples of a chosen number, reinforcing multiplication concepts.

Customizable Tables: Players can select their preferred number table, allowing for a personalized learning experience.

Intuitive Controls: Simple controls (arrow keys) make the game accessible for players of all ages.

# How to Play
Choose Number Table: Start by entering a number to determine the snake's growth pattern. This represents the multiplication table that will be reinforced during gameplay.

Control the Snake: Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake and guide it to consume fruits on the screen.

Multiplicative Learning: Each fruit eaten increases the snake's length based on multiples of the chosen number.

Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with the screen boundaries or itself.
